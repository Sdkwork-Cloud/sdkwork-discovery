> Migrated from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-09-sdkwork-discovery-control-plane.md` on 2026-06-24.
> Owner: SDKWork maintainers

> **Status:** Implemented in the main agent session. This plan is retained as execution evidence and has been updated to match the delivered workspace.

**Goal:** Build the first SDKWork-standard Rust control plane for service discovery and versioned runtime configuration.

**Architecture:** Implement a focused Rust workspace with contract, config, storage-port, memory-store, core-service, and product-bootstrap crates. Keep domain logic independent of generated RPC transport while landing proto and RPC manifest contracts.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 2021, Cargo workspace, serde, toml, thiserror, uuid, sha2, SDKWork specs, proto3 contracts.

- [x] Land proto source and RPC manifest with operation ids.
- [x] Wire Rust proto crate generation from checked-in `.proto` source.
- [x] Implement tonic RPC server adapter, health/reflection controls, TLS/mTLS validation, bounded shutdown, Watch durable replay, live fanout, concurrency caps, and heartbeat.

### Task 7: Verification

**Files:**
- Modify as needed.

- [x] Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
- [x] Run `cargo test --workspace`.
- [x] Run `pnpm.cmd verify`.
